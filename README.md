**Singapore-Flat-Price-Analysis**

PROJECT OBJECTIVE

There are three Parts in the Project Prime Part is on

BANK RISK CONTROLLER SYSTEM, The goal of this project is to develop a reliable predictive model that effectively identifies customers at high risk of loan default. This will allow the financial institution to proactively manage its credit portfolio, implement targeted strategies, and ultimately minimize the likelihood of loan defaults.

Second Part of the Project is "SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS"

Last Part of the Project is "YOLO OBJECT DETECTION"

TECHNOLOGIES USED

  •	PYTHON

DASHBOARD CREATION1:

Streamlit and Plotly libraries are used to create an interactive app and visually appealing dashboard. 
Streamlit App helps user to assess the risk of loan default by using feeding the required data in appropriate manner
This dashboard presents the data in efficient manner which enable users to explore the insights effectively  
DASHBOARD CREATION2:

Sentimental Analysis text box to analysis the postive and negative of statements or comments given by the user
DASHBOARD CREATION3:

  YOLO OBJECT DETECTION to detect the object in the Uploaded Image
OUTPUT INCLUDES :

Streamlit App to assess the risk of loan defaulter
Visually appealing dashboard to understand the data in easy, efficient manner and along with deep insights
Sentimental Analysis box to understand the nature/character of the statements
Yolo Object Detection Dashboard to detect the objects in the image
CONCLUSION:

The BANK RISK CONTROLLER SYSTEM Streamlit App helps to understand insights of various Key features of Dataset as well as helps customers to assess the risk on loan defaulters
