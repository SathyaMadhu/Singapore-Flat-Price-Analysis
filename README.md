**PROJECT OBJECTIVE**

Singapore Flat Price Analsis, The aim of this project is to develop a reliable predictive model that can accuractely predicts the resale Price of the Properties in Singapore.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**

  •	PYTHON
  •	DATA PREPROCESSING
  •	EDA(EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS)
  •	MACHINE LEARNING - CLASSIFICATION MODEL
  •	VISUALIZATION
  •	STREAMLIT GUI

**Dashboard: Streamlit and Plotly**

**PYTHON LIBRARIES/MODULES ENGAGED:**

      •	IMPORT BASE64
      
**PHASES INVOLVED:**

**DATA RETRIEVAL** : Python scripts were employed to import data/datasets from the CSV file

**DATA PRE-PROCESSING** :

  Cleaning and preparing the dataset for further Analysis
    
    •	Handling Missing Values
    •	Formatting
    
**DATA PROCESSING :**

       •	Categorical Data Encoding using **Label Encoder**
       •	Skewness Handling using log transformation
       •	Outlier Treatment - IQR
       •	Training Model
       •	Evaluating Model  

**DASHBOARD CREATION1:**

    •	Streamlit and Plotly libraries are used to create an interactive app and visually appealing dashboard. 
    •	Streamlit App helps to predict the resale price of properties in Singapore
    •	This dashboard presents the data in efficient manner which enable users to explore the insights effectively  

**CONCLUSION:**

The SINGAPORE FLAT PRICE PREDICTION App helps to understand insights of various Key features of Dataset as well as helps to PREDICT the RESALE PRICE OF PROPERTIES IN SINGAPORE
